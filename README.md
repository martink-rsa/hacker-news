# HackerNews Feed (Unofficial)

A HackerNews feed from the HackerNews API made in React with Material-UI.

## Notes regarding project

I unfortunately only become aware of different post types, such as polls, towards the end of the project. I therefore did not cater for them. Polls will result in an item without a title. This is not a complex fix and will be dealt with once the project is revised. See [issues](https://github.com/martink-rsa/hacker-news/issues/1).

## Getting Started

Simply clone the repo or copy the files to your computer.

### Prerequisites

None

### Installing

Step 1: Install the dependencies

Simply add in a search term and press enter for the search to take place. It will default to a query of 'React'.
